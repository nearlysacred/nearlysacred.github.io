In this, our seminal episode, we discuss the Hebrew Goddess and where she went, and why she seems to be missing. We cover the relevant news of the time period and 
discuss various scriptural matters pertaining to things from self-government to the Kabbalah implications of certain letters of the Hebrew alphabet. We even delve into 
some politically "sensitive" issues. You do not want to miss how this all started!
