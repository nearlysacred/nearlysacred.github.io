In this episode, Melissa and Joe Bill interview Stuart Mitchell about his various compositions that utilize a branch of metaphysics. We cover everything from 
"stretched out music", to "DNA music." Stuart discusses the field of music from past composers, as well as some of his experiences from discovering the musical code 
at Rosslyn Chapel. If you are a music lover and you wonder how a modern composer might utilize ancient thought processes, you will want to give this episode a listen!
