In this interview, author Cort Lindahl lets us in on what his research has 
produced. Cort covers a lot of ground in this episode, and it might be prudent 
to dust up on one's sacred geometry before listening to the episode as it is 
replete with important information about a variety of structures that cover 
large swaths of history. Listen to episode six here!
