In this episode, Melissa and Joe Bill candidly discuss their turn and experiences to Messianic Judaism. It is detailed along the way how the awakening experience leads 
up to the critical moment, and what they had to go through in order to find the truth of their beliefs and the beliefs promulgated by others. Fair warning, this 
episode may well throw the listener into their own awakening experience. It is not for the faint of heart.
