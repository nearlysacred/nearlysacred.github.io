In this episode Melissa and Leslie recount their trip to France and their ascent up a mystical mountain that was once the stronghold of the Cathars--Montsegur. Much is 
covered here in detail of the strange experiences they encountered. If you are a fan of the French Mysteries, you will not want to miss this episode!

(Note from Joe Bill: Since we aired this episode, it has become evident that Leslie Cottle prefers to associate in circles that are at once more Roman Catholic and 
simultaneously and paradoxically Nazi-leaning. Although we believe in tolerance for all faiths and understand each have their strengths and weaknessess, it is not true 
that either the Roman Catholic Church historically nor the Nazis showed such leniency. This is, of course, all the more ironic, as Leslie here claims to have a 
fondness for the Cathars who were exterminated by Rome. Clearly, Ms. Cottle is in some contradiction to her statements--the consequence being we no longer associate 
with her. We believe, however, that the voice of experience is valuable and so here re-post this interview with the noted ammendments to this episode.)
