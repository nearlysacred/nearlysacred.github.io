The Lincoln Memorial--one of the icons of the United States. The memorial itself is an almagamation of both Roman and Greek elements.  

When we speak of geometry, we often think of it in terms of physical structure, and so we shall include some of that in the discussion. What is often missed is the "geometry" of the people involved in the creation of a thing, which is part of the information this post will cover.

The mathematical relationships concerning the structure are as follows:

>The exterior of the Memorial echoes a classic Greek temple and features Yule marble from Colorado. The structure measures 189.7 by 118.5 feet (57.8 by 36.1 m) and is 99 feet (30 m) tall. It is surrounded by a peristyle of 36 fluted Doric columns, one for each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death, and two columns in-antis at the entrance behind the colonnade. The columns stand 44 feet (13 m) tall with a base diameter of 7.5 feet (2.3 m). Each column is built from 12 drums including the capital. The columns, like the exterior walls and facades, are inclined slightly toward the building's interior. This is to compensate for perspective distortions which would otherwise make the memorial appear to bulge out at the top when compared with the bottom, a common feature of Ancient Greek architecture.[^1]

If we begin to sum the relevant digits such as 99 we find the result to be 18 which when again summed becomes a nine. Such analysis is helpful when attempting to understand how a compound number is represented as a base digit. We see the same theme once more with the addition of 36. This should not be surprising as nine has a long Egyptian history of "completeness". Likewise, there are strong overtones of this completeness being echoed in the constellation of Virgo:

> Pierre-Charles L’Enfant... adventurous Frenchman and a contemporary of Weishaupt, who was primarily responsible for the name and design of the District of Columbia...
>
>Pierre was educated first as an artist, where he studied the science of landscape design from the works of Andre le Notre, who designed the great historical axis of Paris, and then as a soldier, where he learned the art of fortification.
>
 >In 1776, as a lieutenant, he joined his regimental Masonic lodge where he met the Marquis de Lafayette and many other young Frenchmen fired up by the new ideals of liberty and equality. In 1777, he offered his services to the new Continental Army of General Washington, and was appointed a captain of engineers...
>
 >When he learned, in 1789, that his old friend General Washington was planning to establish a new federal capital down in Virginia, L’Enfant wrote directly to him, announcing that,
>
>“…no nation, perhaps, had ever before the opportunity offered them of deliberately deciding on the spot where their capital city should be fixed.”
>
>Arriving in Georgetown early in 1791, armed with Washington’s instructions to assist the current surveyors... L’Enfant quickly took charge...
>
 >Andrew Ellicott, the chief surveyor was a knowledgeable astronomer, and he undoubtedly helped fix the precise point on the horizon marking the August 11th sunset.
>
>This angle, 22 degrees north of west, did double duty, pointing to the sunset where, 200 years later, the triangle containing Virgo would appear in the sky and also marking the September 18th rising of Sirius over the Capital. This one alignment, from the Capital to the White House, graphically unites the two most prominent astronomical goddess images, Sirius and Virgo.
>
>L’Enfant’s plan was changed through the years, and his steadfast defense of certain points led to his being considered difficult. He wanted to keep intact not only the precise sightlines of his alignments... L’Enfant’s idea was to preserve a direct view of the western horizon for the mid-August time period when the Virgo triangle appeared in the sky... the earthly reflection of the Virgo triangle.[^2]
