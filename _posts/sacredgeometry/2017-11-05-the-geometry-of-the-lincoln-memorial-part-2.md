In our first analysis of the Lincoln Memorial, we noted some of the dimensions of the temple itself. We likewise noted the affinity for the temple to hold Virgo energy. Read more about that post [here](sacredgeometry/2017-10-21-the-geometry-of-the-lincoln-memorial.md). 

The analysis we covered noted the presence of the numbers 18 (hidden) as a sum of 99, and 36 which is explained as being the number of states present in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death.In Hebrew Gematria, 18 is a special number that has the meaning of being a testament to life. Hence, if you wish to give an interval of money, you do so in intervals of 18. 36 is known as double life, which is considered a double blessing. We can conclude then, that the Lincoln memorial is intended to have deep significance for the life of the United States as the name of Lincoln is Abraham and he acted as father of the nation and ultimately was sacrificed to it. 

Another number we did not discuss but which is important nonetheless are the columns which are 44 feet tall. 44 is a number which often shows up in various places, but for the purposes of this analysis the most pertinent connection is in the form of a year. What year is that? 44 B.C. What happened then?

>Julius Caesar, the”dictator for life”of the Roman Empire, is murdered by his own senators at a meeting in a hall next to Pompey’s Theatre. The conspiracy against Caesar encompassed as many as sixty noblemen, including Caesar’s own protege, Marcus Brutus.
>
>Caesar was scheduled to leave Rome to fight in a war on March 18 and had appointed loyal members of his army to rule the Empire in his absence. The Republican senators, already chafing at having to abide by Caesar’s decrees, were particularly angry about the prospect of taking orders from Caesar’s underlings. Cassius Longinus started the plot against the dictator, quickly getting his brother-in-law Marcus Brutus to join.
>
>Caesar should have been well aware that many of the senators hated him, but he dismissed his security force not long before his assassination. Reportedly, Caesar was handed a warning note as he entered the senate meeting that day but did not read it. After he entered the hall, Caesar was surrounded by senators holding daggers. Servilius Casca struck the first blow, hitting Caesar in the neck and drawing blood. The other senators all joined in, stabbing him repeatedly about the head.
>
>Marcus Brutus wounded Caesar in the groin and Caesar is said to have remarked in Greek, “You, too, my child?” In the aftermath of the assassination, Antony attempted to carry out Caesar’s legacy. However, Caesar’s will left Octavian in charge as his adopted son. Cassius and Brutus tried to rally a Republican army and Brutus even issued coins celebrating the assassination, known as the Ides of March. Octavian vowedrevenge against the assassins, two years later Cassius and Brutuscommitted suicide after learning that Octavian’s forces had defeated theirs at the Battle of Philippa in Greece.
>
>Antony took his armies east, where he hooked up with Caesar’s old paramour, Cleopatra. Octavian and Antony fought for many years until Octavian prevailed. In 30 B.C., Antony committed suicide. Octavian, later known as Augustus, ruled the Roman Empire for many more years. [^1]

Julius Caesar was well-loved by the masses--particularly the poor and the middle class. Though the nation had been divided, it seems Lincoln was able to garner a love from the people as well. Isn't it interesting that the memorial made due to Lincoln's betrayal by what history records as a lone gunman also encodes the same numerical sequence as a Roman Caesar who history records as being betrayed by *many* senators? We shall later advance the theory that Lincoln was not, in fact, betrayed by one "crazed gunman" but rather that he was betrayed in a similar way that Caesar was which makes the Lincoln Memorial all the more ironic. The numbers, however, encoded within it cannot help but point to the truth--along with the people involved with its construction. 

Who shall we start with in our analysis? We will start with Lincoln's son, Robert Lincoln in our next post.
